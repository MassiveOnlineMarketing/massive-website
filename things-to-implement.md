# Tags

To implement this feature, you'll need to make changes to both your database schema and your application code. Here's a high-level overview of the steps you'll need to take:

1. Update your database schema: You'll need to add a new Tag model to your Prisma schema in schema.prisma, and add a relation between the Tag and Keyword models. Here's an example of how you can do it:

```javascript

model Tag {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  name      String
  keywords  Keyword[]
}

model Keyword {
  // existing fields...
  tags      Tag[]
}
```

This will create a many-to-many relation between keywords and tags, meaning that each keyword can have multiple tags, and each tag can be associated with multiple keywords.

2. Update your application code: You'll need to update your KeywordsContext and related components to support adding, removing, and filtering keywords by tags. Here's a rough idea of the changes you'll need to make:

- Add a new tags state variable to KeywordsContext to store the current list of tags.
- Update the addKeywords function in KeywordsContext to accept an additional tags parameter and associate the new keywords with the given tags.
- Add a new filterKeywordsByTag function to KeywordsContext that filters the keywords state variable by the given tag.
- Update the KeywordTable component to include a new column for tags, and a new filter input that calls filterKeywordsByTag when its value changes.
- Update the ProjectStats component (replace with your actual component name) to calculate stats based on the filtered keywords.

3. Update your API: You'll need to update your API to support the new tags field when creating and updating keywords. This will likely involve changes to your addKeywordToProject action and related API endpoints.
   Please note that these are high-level steps and the actual implementation might vary based on your specific requirements and existing codebase.
